WMV plugin v2.8 by fccHandler
Released February 18, 2012

This is version 2.8 of my WMV plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 and later
versions.  This zip contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the
plugin.  To use the 32-bit version, create a folder named "Plugins32"
in VirtualDub's program folder, and place the "WMV.vdplugin" file into
that folder.  To use the 64-bit version, create a folder named "Plugins64"
in VirtualDub's program folder, and place the "WMV64.vdplugin" file into
that folder.  VirtualDub will find and use the plugins automatically.

The plugin allows you to open most ASF/WMV files in the latest version
of VirtualDub.  It was compiled with Visual Studio 2005 Pro, and tested
on Windows XP Pro SP3 and Windows 98SE.  I haven't tested it on 64-bit
Windows platforms.  You can download the full plugin source code at
http://fcchandler.home.comcast.net.  Future updates will also be
available at that address.

If necessary I can be contacted at fcchandler at comcast dot net, but I
don't check my e-mail very often unless I'm expecting something.  You'll
get a much quicker response by contacting me at the Unofficial VirtualDub
Support Forums.  (As an administrator I visit there several times a day.)
